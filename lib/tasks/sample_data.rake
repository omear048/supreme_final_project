#Used to create 99 fake users for testing
#Next, we’ll add a Rake task to create sample users. Rake tasks live in the lib/tasks directory, and are defined using namespaces (in this case, :db), as seen in Listing 9.29. (This is a bit advanced, so don’t worry too much about the details.)
#To generate new sample data each time stuff is added to file you must run db:populate (See pg. 535)

namespace :db do
  desc "Fill database with sample data"
  task populate: :environment do   #This line ensures that the Rake task has access to the local Rails environment, including the User model
